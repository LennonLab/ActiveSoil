# ActiveSoil: 
Exploring stoichiometric controls on the active fraction of soil microbial biomass

This repository contains preliminary open-source code, data, figures, & text files for research projects related to a collaborative interdisciplinary study that is poised to: 

* Integrate well-established hypotheses of microbial activity and resource stoichiometry into a testable unified framework
* Explore biological, ecological, and ecosystem feedbacks that scale from individual-level physiology to ecosystem level biogeochemistry
* Push the limits of modern ecological modeling with information intensive and highly dynamic individual-based models.
